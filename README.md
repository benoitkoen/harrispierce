# Harris & Pierce

Since Benjamin Harris and Richard Pierce published the first newspaper in America in 1690, access to information
has never been easier.
Harris & Pierce helps you to sort the content that matters to you so you save time searching for relevant resources.

The associated website www.harrispierce.com gathers articles from different trusted sources (Financial Times, Wall
Street Journal, New York Times, etc...) in a single interface using scraping techniques.

On the welcome page, the user can choose the sources (newspapers and sections) he wants articles from (its history
is kept in memory) and the material is ordered and displayed in a standard format for better readability.
Loggedin users have access to the 'Search' functionality where they can access past articles related to a specific
keyword.

The website design is based on HTML, JavaScript and CSS. The scraping and backend is managed with PHP.

An improved version of the website (including social network like features) has been designed using Django: please
check Harrispierce_django on my Github.

Enjoy!
